# Java-Projects

Here, the repository includes some java projects built by myself. One is a rest API built using springboot, and an implimentation of breadth first search algorithm, another a gui built using java swing package, and a simple game where a human player can play with the computer.

1.API IN SPRING BOOT.
The program is a simple rest api built using springboot. It is also a CRUD application. The program connects with a MySQL databse.

 2.PATH FINDER.
 Uses breadth first search algorithm to find the shortest path through a maze. The starting point and the ending points can be changed. In the program, it uses two parrelal queues   to store row number and column number. And finally prints the shortest path.

3.SIMPLE GUI.
The gui is built using the java swing package. It represents a simple Log-in interface, but with set values.
   user  = "USER",  password  = "PASSWORD".
      
4.TICTACTOE GAME.
The programe is a simple "tictactoe" game where the program takes user input for a human player to play with the computer. Random class is used to generate random numbers to play from computers side.
